# Dimensional Analysis for Quality Control in Manufacturing using Blob Detection

In manufacturing industries, dimensional analysis plays a crucial role in ensuring product quality and conformity to specifications. However, performing dimensional analysis manually is time-consuming and error prone. Automating this process plays critical role in mass scaling the production.  

This challenge aims to develop an image processing solution using blob detection techniques to automate dimensional analysis for quality control in manufacturing. The objective is to preprocess the images, apply morphological image operations for noise reduction, perform image segmentation to identify individual objects, measure the dimensions of blobs accurately, and analyze them in accordance with predefined specifications. By automating this process, manufacturers can improve efficiency, reduce errors, and maintain consistent quality standards.   

The challenge lies in accurately detecting and measuring complex blob shapes, dealing with variations in lighting and background, and handling potential image noise and artifacts.
